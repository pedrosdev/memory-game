# Introduction

A memory game implemented using vanilla JavaScript.

__Obs1__: This was one of the first games I have developed and I'm not sure about how enjoyable it is. If you have any suggestions or want to report a bug you found, please contact me on my LinkedIn profile (I'm not sure if anyone can open issues here, but if you can, that would be fine too).

__Obs2__: Some of the images aren't good, but for now I'm more concerned with the logic.

## Learning goals

Get more practice with event handling and generating content dynamically using JavaScript, and start thinking a little more about UX.
